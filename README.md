# inverted-pendulum
This project features an inverted pendulum system designed and implemented with custom 3D-modeled components, including motor and encoder mounts, a pendulum arm with adjustable weights, anti-slip shaft connectors, and reinforced motor shaft clamps. These parts were printed on an Ender 3 Max 3D printer. 

The hardware setup includes:
- an Omron E6B2-CWZ6C encoder, 
- a Sankyo 557815 DC brushed motor, 
- an L298N motor driver, 
- an Arduino Uno,
- a 12V, 12A power adapter (100-240V, 50-60Hz) with a 2.1mm center-positive plug, 
- a protoboard. 

The system is controlled using Arduino code with a PID controller to stabilize the pendulum. This project demonstrates mechanical design, hardware integration, and control systems expertise.
